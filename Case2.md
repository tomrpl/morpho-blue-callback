## Leveraged Position Setup on Morpho Protocol

Using wstETH and wETH

### Initial Conditions:

User holds 2 wstETH, ready to be used as collateral.
The user intends to leverage this position by borrowing wETH against the wstETH collateral.
The market has a 90% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio and sufficient liquidity.
Assume 1 wstETH is equivalent to 1 wETH for simplicity (adjust as needed).
Workflow Steps:

### Initiate Leverage Position:

Action: User calls the supplyCollateral function on the Morpho protocol.
Parameters:
collateralAmount = 10 wstETH (User's initial 2 wstETH + 8 wstETH equivalent to the borrowed amount).
data: Encoded call to testLeverageCallback with loanAmount (maximum safe amount to borrow is 9 wETH, but user opts for 8 wETH for safety).
Callback Triggering:

Action: Execution of supplyCollateral.
Trigger: Since data.length > 0, it initiates the callback function IMorphoSupplyCollateralCallback(msg.sender).onMorphoSupplyCollateral(10 wstETH, data).
Callback Execution:

a. Selector Identification: Function testLeverageCallback is identified from data.
b. Loan Amount Decoding: The toBorrow amount (8 wETH) is extracted from data.
c. Borrow Transaction: Contract (acting on behalf of the user) borrows 8 wETH from Morpho.
Converting Borrowed wETH to wstETH:

Option A (Standard Swap): Borrowed wETH is swapped for wstETH.
Option B (ETH-Staking Path):
Unwrap 8 wETH to 8 ETH.
Stake 8 ETH to receive an equivalent amount of stETH.
Wrap the received stETH back into wstETH.
Note: This requires contracts to be capable of handling ETH transactions and staking.
Completing the Transaction:

Action: IERC20(marketParams.collateralToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets).
Result: Transfers the total 10 wstETH (2 initial + 8 converted from borrowed wETH) as collateral into the Morpho market.
Final Position:

The user has a leveraged position with approximately 5x leverage.
Supplied: Total of 10 wstETH as collateral.
Borrowed: 8 wETH against the supplied collateral.
Additional Considerations:

Ensure the userâ€™s initial balance includes at least 2 wstETH and has granted Morpho contract sufficient allowance to perform operations.
Market conditions like oracle prices and interest rates are assumed constant for this example.
Assumes no transfer fees or transaction costs in Morpho protocol and underlying tokens.
The example focuses on the atomicity of transactions in Ethereum smart contracts, emphasizing that all steps occur in one transaction.
